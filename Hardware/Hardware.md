<h1> Casing/ Hardware </h1>
<p> I made the casing for the electronics using both 3D printed parts and wood. I would recommend you do the same, but you can easily just use one. The main body/structure of the robot was made out of wood, whereas a single funnel attachment was 3D printed. This funnel attachment wasn't necessary and could easily be substituted with zip ties.
