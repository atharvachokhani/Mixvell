<p> Currently, I\'92m using a web app to run Mixvell through bluetooth. This presents some challenges like losing the ability to control the machine through a tablet, and rather having to use a laptop as my bluetooth module works on bluetooth classic, which is not supported Google Chrome or any other browser on tablets. \
The app is on mixvell.vercel.app and was created using Google AI studio. You can find its files on  <a href=\'93https://github.com/atharvachokhani/Mixvell-App\'94> git </a>. Just download the zip package and use AI studio to re work the app based on your requirements </p>}
